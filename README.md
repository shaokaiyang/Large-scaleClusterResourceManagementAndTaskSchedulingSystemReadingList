# Large-scaleClusterSchedulingSystemReadingList
This is a large-scale cluster resource management and task scheduling system reading list maintained by **BUAA Cloud OS Group Member SKY**  

The large-scale cluster resource management and task scheduling system is an important part of the cluster system. It provides reliable, credible and sustainable resource services for the upper-level computing framework through abstraction, isolation, and sharing of the underlying resources. With the rapid development and popularization of machine learning, artificial intelligence and other technologies, more and more types and quantities of loads need to be scheduled and executed in the cluster. Efficient cluster resource management and task scheduling systems make full use of existing resources through fair strategy or other allocation algorithms to reduce the cost of construction and maintenance of clusters meanwhile ensuring the Quality of Service and Service-Level Agreement. Therefore, the exploration of efficient cluster resource management and task scheduling system has become a research hotspot in academia and industry.

**The list is still incomplete and the categorization might be inappropriate.We will keep adding papers and improving the list. Any suggestions are welcome!**
